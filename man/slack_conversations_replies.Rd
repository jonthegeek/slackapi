timestamp will be included in results.}

\item{inclusive}{(\code{logical}) Include messages with \code{latest} or \code{oldest}
timestamp in results only when either timestamp is specified.}

\item{include_all_metadata}{(\code{logical}) Return all metadata associated with
this message.}

\item{token}{(\code{character}) A bearer token provided by Slack. A later
enhancement will add the ability to generate this token. Slack token are
